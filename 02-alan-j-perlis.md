# Epigrams on Programming

Alan J. Perlis, Yale University   
September 1982

The phenomena surrounding computers are diverse and yield a surprisingly
rich base for launching metaphors at individual and group activities.
Conversely, classical human endeavors provide an inexhaustible source of
metaphor for those of us who are in labor within computation. Such
relationships between society and device are not new, but the incredible
growth of the computer's influence (both real and implied) lends this
symbiotic dependency a vitality like a gangly youth growing out of his
clothes within an endless puberty.

The epigrams that follow attempt to capture some of the dimensions of
this traffic in imagery that sharpens, focuses, clarifies, enlarges and
beclouds our view of this most remarkable of all mans' artifacts, the
computer.

1. One man's constant is another man's variable.
2. Functions delay binding: data structures induce binding. Moral:
   Structure data late in the programming process.
3. Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semi-colons.
4. Every program is a part of some other program and rarely fits.
5. If a program manipulates a large amount of data, it does so in
   a small number of ways.
6. Symmetry is a complexity reducing concept (co-routines include
   sub-routines); seek it everywhere.
7. It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct
   one.
8. A programming language is low level when its programs require
   attention to the irrelevant.
9. It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than
   10 functions on 10 data structures.
10. Get into a rut early: Do the same processes the same way. Accumulate
    idioms. Standardize. The only difference (!) between Shakespeare and
    you was the size of his idiom list --- not the size of his vocabulary.
11. If you have a procedure with 10 parameters, you probably missed
    some.
12. Recursion is the root of computation since it trades description for
    time.
13. If two people write exactly the same program, each should be put in
    micro-code and then they certainly won't be the same.
14. In the long run every program becomes rococo --- then rubble.
15. Everything should be built top-down, except the first time.
16. Every program has (at least) two purposes: the one for which it was
    written and another for which it wasn't.
17. If a listener nods his head when you're explaining your program,
    wake him up.
18. A program without a loop and a structured variable isn't worth
    writing.
19. A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming,
    is not worth knowing.
20. Wherever there is modularity there is the potential for
    misunderstanding: Hiding information implies a need to check
    communication.
21. Optimization hinders evolution.
22. A good system can't have a weak command language.
23. To understand a program you must become both the machine and the
    program.
24. Perhaps if we wrote programs from childhood on, as adults we'd be
    able to read them.
25. One can only display complex information in the mind. Like seeing,
    movement or flow or alteration of view is more important than the
    static picture, no matter how lovely.
26. There will always be things we wish to say in our programs that in
    all known languages can only be said poorly.
27. Once you understand how to write a program get someone else to write
    it.
28. Around computers it is difficult to find the correct unit of time to
    measure progress. Some cathedrals took a century to complete. Can
    you imagine the grandeur and scope of a program that would take as long?
29. For systems, the analogue of a face-lift is to add to the control
    graph an edge that creates a cycle, not just an additional node.
30. In programming, everything we do is a special case of something more
    general --- and often we know it too quickly.
31. Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.
32. Programmers are not to be measured by their ingenuity and their
    logic but by the completeness of their case analysis.
33. The 11th commandment was "Thou Shalt Compute" or "Thou Shalt Not
    Compute" --- I forget which.
34. The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed
    there is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for
    hiding information.
35. Everyone can be taught to sculpt: Michelangelo would have had to be
    taught how not to. So it is with the great programmers.
36. The use of a program to prove the 4-color theorem will not change
    mathematics --- it merely demonstrates that the theorem, a challenge
    for a century, is probably not important to mathematics.
37. The most important computer is the one that rages in our skulls and
    ever seeks that satisfactory external emulator. The standardization
    of real computers would be a disaster --- and so it probably won't happen.
38. Structured Programming supports the law of the excluded muddle.
39. Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words --- but only those to
    describe the picture. Hardly any sets of 10K words can be adequately
    described with pictures.
40. There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one
    works.
41. Some programming languages manage to absorb change, but withstand
    progress.
42. You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on
    the continuing vitality of FORTRAN.
43. In software systems it is often the early bird that makes the worm.
44. Sometimes I think the only universal in the computing field is the
    fetch-execute-cycle.
45. The goal of computation is the emulation of our synthetic abilities,
    not the understanding of our analytic ones.
46. Like punning, programming is a play on words.
47. As Will Rogers would have said, "There is no such thing as a free variable."
48. The best book on programming for the layman is "Alice in
    Wonderland"; but that's because it's the best book on anything for
    the layman.
49. Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden:
    Languages whose use squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP
    machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon bra and fig-leaf.
50. When we understand knowledge-based systems, it will be as before ---
    except our finger-tips will have been singed.
51. Bringing computers into the home won't change either one, but may
    revitalize the corner saloon.
52. Systems have sub-systems and sub-systems have sub-systems and so on
    ad finitum --- which is why we're always starting over.
53. So many good ideas are never heard from again once they embark in
    a voyage on the semantic gulf.
54. Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but
    nothing of interest is easy.
55. A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of
    nothing.
56. Software is under a constant tension. Being symbolic it is
    arbitrarily perfectible; but also it is arbitrarily changeable.
57. It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than
    vice versa.
58. Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it.
    Geniuses remove it.
59. In English every word can be verbed. Would that it were so in our
    programming languages.
60. Dana Scott is the Church of the Lattice-Way Saints.
61. In programming, as in everything else, to be in error is to be
    reborn.
62. In computing, invariants are ephemeral.
63. When we write programs that "learn", it turns out we do and they don't.
64. Often it is means that justify ends: Goals advance technique and
    technique survives even when goal structures crumble.
65. Make no mistake about it: Computers process numbers --- not symbols.
    We measure our understanding (and control) by the extent to which we
    can arithmetize an activity.
66. Making something variable is easy. Controlling duration of constancy
    is the trick.
67. Think of all the psychic energy expended in seeking a fundamental
    distinction between "algorithm" and "program".
68. If we believe in data structures, we must believe in independent
    (hence simultaneous) processing. For why else would we collect items
    within a structure? Why do we tolerate languages that give us the one
    without the other?
69. In a 5 year period we get one superb programming language. Only we
    can't control when the 5 year period will begin.
70. Over the centuries the Indians developed sign language for
    communicating phenomena of interest. Programmers from different
    tribes (FORTRAN, LISP, ALGOL, SNOBOL, etc.) could use one that doesn't
    require them to carry a blackboard on their ponies.
71. Documentation is like term insurance: It satisfies because almost no
    one who subscribes to it depends on its benefits.
72. An adequate bootstrap is a contradiction in terms.
73. It is not a language's weaknesses but its strengths that control the
    gradient of its change: Alas, a language never escapes its embryonic
    sac.
74. It is possible that software is not like anything else, that it is
    meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to always see it as
    soap bubble?
75. Because of its vitality, the computing field is always in desperate
    need of new cliches: Banality soothes our nerves.
76. It is the user who should parametrize procedures, not their
    creators.
77. The cybernetic exchange between man, computer and algorithm is like
    a game of musical chairs: The frantic search for balance always
    leaves one of the three standing ill at ease.
78. If your computer speaks English it was probably made in Japan.
79. A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one
    believe in God.
80. Prolonged contact with the computer turns mathematicians into clerks
    and vice versa.
81. In computing, turning the obvious into the useful is a living
    definition of the word "frustration".
82. We are on the verge: Today our program proved Fermat's next-to-last
    theorem!
83. What is the difference between a Turing machine and the modern
    computer? It's the same as that between Hillary's ascent of Everest
    and the establishment of a Hilton hotel on its peak.
84. Motto for a research laboratory: What we work on today, others will
    first think of tomorrow.
85. Though the Chinese should adore APL, it's FORTRAN they put their
    money on.
86. We kid ourselves if we think that the ratio of procedure to data in
    an active data-base system can be made arbitrarily small or even
    kept small.
87. We have the mini and the micro computer. In what semantic niche
    would the pico computer fall?
88. It is not the computer's fault that Maxwell's equations are not
    adequate to design the electric motor.
89. One does not learn computing by using a hand calculator, but one can
    forget arithmetic.
90. Computation has made the tree flower.
91. The computer reminds one of Lon Chaney --- it is the machine of
    a thousand faces.
92. The computer is the ultimate polluter. Its feces are
    indistinguishable from the food it produces.
93. When someone says "I want a programming language in which I need
    only say what I wish done," give him a lollipop.
94. Interfaces keep things tidy, but don't accelerate growth: Functions
    do.
95. Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for
    them.
96. Computers don't introduce order anywhere as much as they expose
    opportunities.
97. When a professor insists computer science is X but not Y, have
    compassion for his graduate students.
98. In computing, the mean time to failure keeps getting shorter.
99. In man-machine symbiosis, it is man who must adjust: The machines
    can't.
100. We will never run out of things to program as long as there is
     a single program around.
101. Dealing with failure is easy: Work hard to improve: Success is also
     easy to handle: You've solved the wrong problem. Work hard to
    improve.
102. One can't proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.
103. Purely applicative languages are poorly applicable.
104. The proof of a system's value is its existence.
105. You can't communicate complexity, only an awareness of it.
106. It's difficult to extract sense from strings, but they're the only
     communication coin we can count on.
107. The debate rages on: Is PL/I Bachtrian or Dromedary?
108. Whenever two programmers meet to criticize their programs, both are
     silent.
109. Think of it! With VLSI we can pack 100 ENIACs in 1 sq.cm.
110. Editing is a rewording activity.
111. Why did the Roman Empire collapse? What is the Latin for office
     automation?
112. Computer Science is embarrassed by the computer.
113. The only constructive theory connecting neuroscience and psychology
     will arise from the study of software.
114. Within a computer natural language is unnatural.
115. Most people find the concept of programming obvious, but the doing
     impossible.
116. You think you know when you learn, are more sure when you can
     write, even more when you can teach, but certain when you can
     program.
117. It goes against the grain of modern education to teach children to
     program. What fun is there in making plans, acquiring discipline in
     organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail and learning to be
     self-critical?
118. If you can imagine a society in which the computer-robot is the
     only menial, you can imagine anything.
119. Programming is an unnatural act.
120. Adapting old programs to fit new machines usually means adapting
     new machines to behave like old ones.
121. In seeking the unattainable, simplicity only gets in the way.

If there are epigrams, there must be meta-epigrams.

122. Epigrams are interfaces across which appreciation and insight flow.
123. Epigrams parametrize auras.
124. Epigrams are macros, since they are executed at read time.
125. Epigrams crystallize incongruities.
126. Epigrams retrieve deep semantics from a data base that is all
     procedure.
127. Epigrams scorn detail and make a point: They are a superb
     high-level documentation.
128. Epigrams are more like vitamins than protein.
129. Epigrams have extremely low entropy.
130. The last epigram? Neither eat nor drink them, snuff epigrams.
